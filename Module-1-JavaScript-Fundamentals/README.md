## Challenges

After each lesson, you'll find coding challenges that reinforce what you've learned. Try to solve them on your own before looking at the solutions!

## Project: Personal Task Tracker

At the end of this module, you'll build a simple task tracker application using JavaScript. This project will help you apply all the concepts you've learned in a practical way.

## How to Use Cursor's AI to Help You Learn

When you're working through the lessons and challenges, you can use Cursor's AI assistant (Cmd+K or Ctrl+K) to:

1. Ask for explanations of concepts you don't understand
2. Get hints when you're stuck on a challenge
3. Debug your code when it's not working as expected

Remember, the goal is to learn, not just to complete the exercises. Don't be afraid to experiment and make mistakes!
