# Challenges: Introduction to JavaScript

Welcome to your first set of coding challenges, Sam! These exercises will help you practice what you've learned in Lesson 1.

## Challenge 1: Hello, World!

Create a file called `hello-world.js` and write a program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

<details>
<summary>Hint (click to expand)</summary>
Use the `console.log()` function to print messages to the console.
</details>

## Challenge 2: Personal Introduction

Create a file called `introduction.js` and write a program that:
1. Creates a variable with your name
2. Creates a variable with your favorite hobby
3. Prints a message that includes both variables

For example: "My name is Sam and I enjoy hiking."

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
You can use the `+` operator to combine (concatenate) strings.
</details>

## Challenge 3: Simple Calculator

Create a file called `calculator.js` and write a program that:
1. Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers
2. Prints each result to the console with a descriptive message

For example:
```
10 + 5 = 15
10 - 5 = 5
10 * 5 = 50
10 / 5 = 2
```

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
You can use variables to store the numbers and then perform operations on them.
</details>

## Challenge 4: Temperature Converter

Create a file called `temperature.js` and write a program that:
1. Converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius
2. Prints both temperatures to the console

The formula for conversion is: `Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9`

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
1. Create a variable to store the Fahrenheit temperature
2. Use the formula to calculate the Celsius temperature
3. Print both temperatures with appropriate labels
</details>

## Challenge 5: Ask Cursor AI

This challenge is different! Open Cursor's AI assistant (Cmd+K or Ctrl+K) and ask it to explain one of the following concepts:
1. What is the difference between `let` and `const` in JavaScript?
2. What are the different data types in JavaScript?
3. How does JavaScript run in a web browser?

Write down what you learn in a file called `learning-notes.js` as comments.

## How to Run Your Solutions

Remember, you can run your JavaScript files using Node.js in the terminal:

```
node filename.js
```

## Next Steps

Once you've completed these challenges, you're ready to move on to [Lesson 2: Variables and Data Types](../lessons/02-variables-data-types.md)!

If you get stuck, don't hesitate to:
1. Review the lesson material
2. Check the hints provided
3. Ask Cursor's AI for help
4. Look at the solution files (but try to solve the challenges on your own first!)
