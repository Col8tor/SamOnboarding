# Lesson 1: Introduction to Programming and JavaScript

## What is Programming?

Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer to perform specific tasks. Think of it like writing a recipe for a computer to follow. Just as a recipe has steps that need to be followed in a specific order, a program has instructions that the computer executes in sequence.

The key difference is that computers are very literal - they'll do exactly what you tell them to do, not what you meant to tell them to do. This is why precision is important in programming.

## Why JavaScript?

JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and for good reason:

1. **It's everywhere**: JavaScript runs in every web browser, making it the language of the web.
2. **Versatility**: You can use JavaScript for frontend web development, backend servers, mobile apps, and even desktop applications.
3. **Beginner-friendly**: JavaScript has a relatively simple syntax that's easier to learn compared to some other languages.
4. **Huge community**: There are countless resources, libraries, and frameworks available for JavaScript.
5. **Immediate feedback**: You can see the results of your code right away in a browser.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

One of the great things about JavaScript is that you don't need to install anything special to get started. You already have everything you need:

1. **A text editor**: You're using Cursor, which is perfect for writing JavaScript code.
2. **A web browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge - any modern browser will work.

## Your First JavaScript Program

Let's write your very first JavaScript program! Create a new file called `hello.js` in the challenges folder of this module.

```javascript
// This is a comment. Comments are ignored by the computer.
// They're just notes for humans reading the code.

// This line prints a message to the console
console.log("Hello, Sam! Welcome to the world of programming!");

// Let's do some simple math
console.log(2 + 3);  // This will print 5

// We can also store values in variables
let name = "Sam";
console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");  // This will print "Hello, Sam!"
```

### How to Run Your JavaScript Code

There are two easy ways to run JavaScript code:

1. **Using the browser console**:
   - Open your web browser
   - Right-click anywhere on a page and select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element"
   - Go to the "Console" tab
   - Type or paste your JavaScript code and press Enter

2. **Using Node.js** (which comes with Cursor):
   - Open the terminal in Cursor
   - Navigate to the folder containing your JavaScript file
   - Type `node hello.js` and press Enter

## Key Concepts to Remember

- **Syntax**: The rules that define how JavaScript code must be structured.
- **Statement**: A single instruction in JavaScript, usually ending with a semicolon (;).
- **Console.log()**: A function that outputs a message to the console.
- **Comments**: Notes in the code that are ignored by the computer, starting with `//`.

## Try It Yourself

Now that you've seen some basic JavaScript code, try modifying the examples above:

1. Change the message that's printed
2. Try different math operations (like subtraction, multiplication, or division)
3. Create a new variable with your favorite hobby and print a message about it

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, we'll dive deeper into variables and data types in JavaScript. But first, head over to the [challenges](../challenges/01-introduction-challenges.md) to practice what you've learned!

Remember, learning to code is like learning a new language - it takes practice and patience. Don't worry if everything doesn't make perfect sense right away. Keep experimenting and asking questions!
