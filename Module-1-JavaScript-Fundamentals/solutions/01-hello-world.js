// Solution to Challenge 1: Hello, World!

// This is the simplest JavaScript program that outputs text to the console
console.log("Hello, World!");

// You can also use double quotes or backticks for strings in JavaScript
// console.log('Hello, World!');
// console.log(`Hello, World!`);

// Remember: In programming, we often start with a "Hello, World!" program
// as a way to verify that our environment is set up correctly and to
// get familiar with the basic syntax of a language.
