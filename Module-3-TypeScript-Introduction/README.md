# Module 3: Introduction to TypeScript

Welcome to Module 3, Sam! Now that you've learned the fundamentals of JavaScript, it's time to explore TypeScript - a powerful superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to make your code more robust and maintainable.

## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is JavaScript with added type definitions. It was developed by Microsoft to address some of the limitations of JavaScript, particularly for large-scale applications. TypeScript code is transpiled (converted) into JavaScript before it runs in the browser or Node.js environment.

## Why Learn TypeScript?

1. **Catch errors early**: TypeScript's static typing helps catch errors during development rather than at runtime
2. **Better tooling**: Enhanced code completion, navigation, and refactoring support in editors like Cursor
3. **Improved readability**: Type annotations make code more self-documenting
4. **Safer refactoring**: Types help ensure changes don't break existing functionality
5. **Modern JavaScript features**: TypeScript supports the latest JavaScript features, even for older browsers
6. **Industry adoption**: Many popular frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue support TypeScript

## What You'll Learn

- **Lesson 1:** Introduction to TypeScript
  - Setting up a TypeScript environment
  - Basic type annotations
  - Compiling TypeScript to JavaScript

- **Lesson 2:** TypeScript Types
  - Primitive types (number, string, boolean)
  - Arrays and tuples
  - Objects and interfaces
  - Union and intersection types

- **Lesson 3:** Functions in TypeScript
  - Function parameter and return types
  - Optional and default parameters
  - Function overloading
  - Arrow functions with types

- **Lesson 4:** Classes and Interfaces
  - Creating classes with TypeScript
  - Access modifiers (public, private, protected)
  - Implementing interfaces
  - Inheritance and abstract classes

- **Lesson 5:** Advanced Types
  - Type aliases
  - Generics
  - Utility types
  - Type assertions

- **Lesson 6:** TypeScript with Modern JavaScript
  - Modules and namespaces
  - Async/await with types
  - Decorators
  - Using third-party libraries with TypeScript

## Project: Task Tracker 2.0

You'll rebuild your Task Tracker application from Module 1, but this time using TypeScript! This will demonstrate how TypeScript can improve your existing JavaScript code by adding type safety and better structure.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should:
1. Be comfortable with JavaScript fundamentals (variables, functions, objects, arrays)
2. Understand basic object-oriented programming concepts
3. Have completed Modules 1 and 2

## How to Use This Module

Each lesson includes:
- Explanations of TypeScript concepts
- Code examples to illustrate these concepts
- Challenges to practice what you've learned
- Solutions to check your work

## Getting Started

Start with [Lesson 1: Introduction to TypeScript](./lessons/01-typescript-introduction.md) to begin your TypeScript journey!

Remember, TypeScript builds on your JavaScript knowledge, so you're not starting from scratch. Many concepts will be familiar, just with the added benefit of type safety.
