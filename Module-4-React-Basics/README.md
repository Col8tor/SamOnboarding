# Module 4: React Basics

Welcome to Module 4, Sam! Now that you've learned JavaScript and TypeScript, it's time to dive into React - one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces.

## What is React?

React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It allows you to create reusable UI components and efficiently update the DOM when your data changes, using a concept called the "virtual DOM."

## Why Learn React?

1. **Component-based architecture**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state
2. **Declarative approach**: Design simple views for each state in your application
3. **Learn once, write anywhere**: Build web, mobile (React Native), and desktop applications
4. **Strong community**: Large ecosystem of libraries, tools, and community support
5. **Industry demand**: React is widely used by companies like Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, and Airbnb
6. **Modern development**: React embraces functional programming concepts and modern JavaScript features
