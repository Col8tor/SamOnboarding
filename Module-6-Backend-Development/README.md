# Module 6: Backend Development with Node.js

Welcome to Module 6, Sam! Now that you've learned frontend development with JavaScript, TypeScript, and React, it's time to explore the server side of web development. In this module, you'll learn how to build backend services and HTTP APIs using Node.js and Express.

## What is Backend Development?

Backend development involves creating the server-side logic that powers web applications. This includes handling database operations, authentication, authorization, business logic, and serving data to the frontend through APIs.

## Why Learn Backend Development?

1. **Full-stack capability**: Combine with your frontend skills to build complete applications
2. **JavaScript everywhere**: Use the same language (JavaScript/TypeScript) on both frontend and backend
3. **API development**: Learn to create and maintain APIs that your frontend applications can consume
4. **Server-side logic**: Implement business logic, data processing, and security on the server
5. **Career opportunities**: Expand your job prospects by being able to work on both sides of web development
6. **Build your own products**: Create complete web applications from scratch

## What You'll Learn

- **Lesson 1:** Introduction to Node.js
  - What is Node.js and how it works
  - Setting up a Node.js development environment
  - Understanding the event loop and asynchronous programming
  - Creating a simple HTTP server

- **Lesson 2:** Express.js Framework
  - Setting up an Express application
  - Routing and middleware
  - Handling requests and responses
  - Error handling

- **Lesson 3:** RESTful API Development
  - REST principles and best practices
  - Creating API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Request validation
  - API documentation

- **Lesson 4:** Working with Databases
  - Introduction to databases (SQL vs. NoSQL)
  - Connecting to a database (MongoDB)
  - CRUD operations
  - Data modeling

- **Lesson 5:** Authentication and Authorization
  - User registration and login
  - JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
  - Protecting routes
  - Role-based access control

- **Lesson 6:** Testing and Deployment
  - Writing tests for your API
  - Error handling and logging
  - Deploying your application
  - Environment variables and configuration

## Project: Task Tracker API

You'll build a RESTful API for your Task Tracker application! This will allow your React frontend to communicate with a backend server that stores tasks in a database. You'll implement user authentication so each user can have their own tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should:
1. Be comfortable with JavaScript fundamentals
2. Understand asynchronous programming (promises, async/await)
3. Have completed the previous modules, especially Module 1 (JavaScript Fundamentals)

## How to Use This Module

Each lesson includes:
- Explanations of backend development concepts
- Code examples to illustrate these concepts
- Challenges to practice what you've learned
- Solutions to check your work

## Getting Started

Start with [Lesson 1: Introduction to Node.js](./lessons/01-nodejs-introduction.md) to begin your backend development journey!

Remember, backend development introduces new concepts like server management, databases, and API design. Take your time to understand each concept thoroughly, and don't hesitate to use Cursor's AI assistant if you need help!
