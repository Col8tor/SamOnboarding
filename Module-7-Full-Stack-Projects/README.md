# Module 7: Full-Stack Projects

Congratulations on making it to Module 7, Sam! You've learned JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and backend development with Node.js. Now it's time to put all these skills together to build complete full-stack applications.

## What is Full-Stack Development?

Full-stack development involves working on both the frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side) of web applications. As a full-stack developer, you can create entire web applications from start to finish, handling everything from the user interface to the database.

## Why Build Full-Stack Projects?

1. **Apply all your skills**: Use everything you've learned in previous modules
2. **Build portfolio pieces**: Create impressive projects to showcase to potential employers
3. **Understand the big picture**: See how all parts of a web application work together
4. **Solve real problems**: Build applications that address actual user needs
5. **Prepare for real-world development**: Experience the entire development lifecycle
6. **Gain confidence**: Prove to yourself that you can build complete applications

## Projects You'll Build

In this module, you'll work on three increasingly complex full-stack projects:

### Project 1: Task Tracker Pro

Build a complete task management application with:
- React frontend with TypeScript
- Node.js/Express backend
- MongoDB database
- User authentication
- Task categories and priorities
- Due dates and reminders
- Filtering and sorting options

### Project 2: Social Media Dashboard

Create a social media management tool that:
- Displays posts from multiple platforms
- Allows scheduling of new posts
- Provides analytics on post performance
- Supports multiple user accounts
- Includes a responsive design for mobile and desktop

### Project 3: E-Commerce Store

Develop a fully functional online store with:
- Product catalog with categories
- Shopping cart functionality
- User accounts and order history
- Payment processing (simulated)
- Admin dashboard for managing products
- Order tracking and management

## How This Module Works

Unlike previous modules, this one is more project-focused:

1. Each project has a detailed requirements document
2. You'll be given starter code and guidance on implementation
3. The projects are broken down into manageable milestones
4. You'll have access to solution code if you get stuck
5. Each project builds on skills from the previous one

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have completed:
1. Module 1: JavaScript Fundamentals
2. Module 3: TypeScript Introduction
3. Module 4: React Basics
4. Module 6: Backend Development

## Getting Started

Start with [Project 1: Task Tracker Pro](./projects/01-task-tracker-pro/README.md) to begin building your first full-stack application!

Remember, building full-stack applications is challenging, but also incredibly rewarding. Don't be discouraged if you encounter difficulties - that's part of the learning process. Use Cursor's AI assistant to help you when you get stuck, and take pride in each feature you successfully implement!
