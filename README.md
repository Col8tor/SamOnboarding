# Sam's Coding Journey

Welcome to your personalized coding journey, Sam! This repository is designed to take you from a complete beginner to building full-stack web applications using JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and backend technologies.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Start with Module 1 and progress in order
2. Read the lesson materials in each module
3. Complete the coding challenges and exercises
4. Use Cursor's AI tools (press Cmd+K or Ctrl+K) when you get stuck
5. Build the mini-projects to apply what you've learned

## Learning Path

* **Module 1:** JavaScript Fundamentals
* **Module 2:** Advanced JavaScript Concepts
* **Module 3:** Introduction to TypeScript
* **Module 4:** React Basics
* **Module 5:** Building React Applications
* **Module 6:** Backend Development with Node.js
* **Module 7:** Full-Stack Projects

## Structure

Each module contains:
- **Lessons:** Step-by-step explanations with examples
- **Challenges:** Small coding exercises to practice concepts
- **Projects:** Hands-on applications to build
- **Resources:** Additional materials for deeper understanding
- **Solutions:** Reference implementations (try to solve challenges on your own first!)

## Tips for Success

- **Code daily:** Even 20-30 minutes each day is better than cramming
- **Type everything:** Don't copy-paste code; typing builds muscle memory
- **Experiment:** Try changing code to see what happens
- **Use AI wisely:** Ask Cursor's AI to explain concepts or debug, but solve problems yourself first
- **Be patient:** Learning to code takes time, and that's completely normal

## Getting Help

When you're stuck:
1. Try to solve the problem yourself first
2. Use Cursor's AI (Cmd+K or Ctrl+K) to ask for hints or explanations
3. Check the provided solutions after attempting the challenge

Happy coding, Sam! Let's start this exciting journey together.
